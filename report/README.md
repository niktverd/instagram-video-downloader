# Knip Report

This directory contains the report generated by [knip](https://github.com/webpro/knip), a tool that helps identify unused files, dependencies, and exports in your codebase.

## Available Report

- **knip.md**: Standard report with information about unused exports, types, dependencies, and files.

## How to Generate the Report

Run the following npm script:

```bash
# Generate the knip report
npm run knip
```

## Git Pre-commit Hook

This project has a Git pre-commit hook that automatically runs knip before each commit. The hook works as follows:

1. When you attempt to commit changes, the pre-commit hook runs
2. It generates a fresh knip report
3. It compares the new report with the previous one
4. If new issues are detected, the commit is blocked
5. You'll need to fix the issues before you can commit

This ensures that no new unused code is introduced into the codebase.

### Bypassing the Hook

In rare cases where you need to bypass the hook (e.g., for a temporary commit that will be fixed later), you can use:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## Understanding the Report

The knip.md report will show you:

- Unused exports in your codebase
- Unused exported enum members
- Unnecessary dependencies or devDependencies
- Unused files
- Unused types

You can use this information to clean up your codebase and improve its maintainability.
